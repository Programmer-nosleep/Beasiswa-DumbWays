To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

To run in browser (HTML):

```bash
bun run dev:dom
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` (the server will compile `index.ts` into `/index.js` automatically).

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.3.5. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
